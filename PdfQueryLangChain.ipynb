Today, I, as the Finance Minister of the Government of Nepal,  present the budget for the \\ncoming Fiscal Year 2023/24 to this joint session of the august Federal Parliament.  \\n2. I pay my respects  and a heartfelt tribute to all the known  and unknown martyrs who sacrificed \\ntheir lives during various political movements for the attainment of democracy and the \\nestablishment of a Federal Democratic Republic system.  \\n3. Elections for the federal, provincial , and local levels , and the President and Vice -President , \\nhave been successfully completed for the second time following  the promulgation of the \\nConstitution of Nepal. This has generated new enthusias m among the people and has \\nsignificantly contributed to the implementation of the Constitution and the \\ninstitutionalization of  the Federal Democratic Republic system. I take this opportunity to \\ncongratulate all the Nepali peop le, including the newly elected Right Honourable  President, \\nVice President , and all the elected representatives , and wish them  a successful tenure.  \\n4. Today marks  the Republic Day of Nepal. On this special occasion , I extend my best wishes to \\nall Nepali brothers and sisters , both  inside and outside Nepal.  \\n5. I have tailored  this budget to address the emerging problems and challenges of the economy , \\nto invigorate  the economy , boost the morale of the private sector , and build a strong \\nfoundation for high, sustainable , and broad -based economic growth. I have targeted the \\nbudget and associated programs  towards addressing the people’s aspirations for \\ndeve lopment and prosperity and providing access to economic benefits for marginalized and \\nbackward communities across  different classes, geographical regions, and genders . \\n6. The upcoming  budget is targeted  towards good governance, social justice , and prosperity. \\nThe budget is designed to promote  industries with highly  competitive as well as comparative \\nadvantages, to foster the development of a digital and green econ omy, to motivate  youths \\nto engage in economic activities within the country, to reduce  poverty through \\nentrepreneurship development, to protect  public assets , and to drive  effective and result -\\nbased resource mobilization.  \\n7. I have  considered the Constitution of Nepal, suggestions received from the honourable  \\nMembers of Parliament, the periodic plan, sustainable development goals, priorities and \\ncommon minimum program  of the coalition government, policies and p rograms of the \\nGovernment of Nepal , and the principles and priorities of the Appropriation Bill as guiding \\nfactors  as guiding factors while formulating this budget . Likewise , I have also taken  into \\naccount  the suggestions received from the Provincial and Local levels, political parties, \\nassociations, academia, the general public, civil society, the private sector , and the media as \\nthe foundation for  the budget.  \\n8. In formulating  this budget, I have understood  the responsibility to address the people’s \\naspirations and to instil  hope and confidence among the people by rectifying  the obstacles  in NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSLATION  \\n3 the economy. I believe  that the obje ctives of this budget can be realized  by confronting  the \\nchallenges that exist  in the economy  through the cooperation  and solidarity among the \\npolitical parties, elected representatives, public administration, institutions, pr ivate sector, \\ncivil society, non -resident Nepalis, development partners, media , and the general public.  \\nRight Honourable Speaker  \\nRight Honourable Chair  \\nLet me present  the current economic scenario of the Country and a brief review of the \\nimplementation of the current year’s budget : \\n9. For the current Fiscal Year, economic growth at base prices is estimated to be 2.16 percent. \\nThe global economic downturn , alongside  domestic factors, has slowed economic activities \\nand is likely to lead to  a decrease  in economic growth.  \\n10. As of  mid-April of the current Fiscal Year, inflation stood  at 7.76 percent. This inflation rate  \\nhas been influenced  by a rise in import prices and the devaluation of the Nepalese currency \\nagainst the US dollar.  \\n11. As of  mid-April of the current Fiscal Year, the balance of payment registered  a surplus of Rs. \\n180.17 billion. Foreign exchange reserves seem  adequate to cover the  imports of goods for \\n11 months and the import of goods an d services for 9.4 months. Remittance inflows have \\nincreased by 24.2 percent  to Rs. 903 billion . \\n12. The revised total government expenditure for the fiscal year 2022/23 is estimated to be Rs. \\n1504.99 billion,  accounting for  83.90 percent of the original estimate. Of this  total \\ngovernment expenditure, the revised current expenditure, capital expenditure , and financing \\nare estimated to be Rs. 1043.39 billion  (88.18 percent), Rs. 258.34 billion (67.91 percent ), and \\nRs. 203.26 billion (88.29 percent), respectively.  \\n13. The revised target for revenue collection in the current Fiscal Year is estimated to be Rs \\n1179.84 billion, which is 84 percent of the initial target and is 5.95 percent lower compared \\nto the actual collection of the previous Fiscal Year. The performance of revenue  collection \\nremained weak, primar ily due to import restriction policy and the economic slowdown.  \\n14. The revised estimate for foreign grant and loan amounts to  Rs. 38.46 billion and Rs. 170.54 \\nbillion, respectively. The level of foreign aid mobilization was lower than expected , primarily  \\ndue to weak project implementation performance.  \\n15. The revised estimate for internal loan mobilization in the current Fiscal Year  is Rs. 256 billion.  \\nThe total public debt stock as of  mid-April 2 023 stood at Rs. 2134.32 billion, comprised  of an \\ninternal debt of Rs.1063.67 billion and foreign debt of Rs. 1070.65 billion.  \\n16. I have already submitted the Economic Survey to this august House. The Survey contains  key \\neconomic and  social indicators and statistics of the current Fiscal Year , as well as the progress \\nof the Public Enterprises . NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSLATION  \\n4 Right Honourable Speaker  \\nRight Honourable Chair  \\nLet me now present a summary of the major challenges and opportunities seen in the economy \\nand the budget system:  \\n17. Economic growth has remained low due to  a slackening of economic activities , which  resulted \\nfrom structural and some policy -related reasons. The Nepali economy was on a path to \\nrecovery from the COVID -19 pandemic , but  the war in Ukraine has adversely affected the \\nsupply chain . Reduced  investment due to high interest rates , low levels  of capital \\nexpenditure, and a decline in aggregate demand have caused further slackness in economic \\nactivities. Policies aimed at containing  inflation and improving  foreign exchange reserves  \\nhave added to t his effect.  In this context, we face the  challenge of achieving  high, sustainable , \\nand broad -based economic growth.  \\n18. Although inflation is gradually moderating, it remains  above the desired limit. Price rises  in \\nfood, dairy  products, household consumer goods , imported goods , and the depreciation of \\nthe Nepali currency against the US dollar have put pressure on consumer prices. Our \\nchallenge is to contain inflation and maintain macroeconomic stability.  \\n19. General government expenditure is increasing. Around  Rs 1,280.25 billion needs  to be \\nallocated to manage  committed expenditures, such as salary, allowances, social security, \\nfiscal transfers, administrative expenses, and increa sing debt repayment liabilities. This \\namount is calculated to be 73.10 percent of the total budget. Therefore,  resource \\nmanagement for development programs is under pressure as a significant share of the total \\nbudget must be allocated for essential expenditure.  \\n20. The effectiveness of capital expenditure performance has not yet improved . There is a \\ntendency to disperse  resources without completing  preparatory activities and project \\nprioritizatio n, resulting  in weak implementation. The challenge we face  is to enhance  the \\nquality of public expenditure.  \\n21. Revenue collection progress is below target in the current Fiscal Year. I recognize  the need \\nfor reform in the revenue system, control of leakages , and increased  revenue mobilization by \\nbroadening the tax base. It\\'s challenging to gradually shift the  revenue structure from indirect \\nand import -based to direct and domestic production -based revenues . \\n22. In Nepal, private sector investment has not increased as expected. Despite having a policy for \\nforeign capital and technology mobilization , the inflo w of foreign investment has not been \\nrealized as expected. There is a need to expand both domestic and foreign investment by \\ncreating an investment -friendly environment.  \\n23. It\\'s been challenging  to professionalize, streamline,  and make public administration result -\\noriented so as to effectively mobilize them in achieving the government\\'s  objectives.  NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSLATION  \\n5 24. Despite the challenges mentioned above , the initiatives taken by the government have begun  \\nto reflect positively on  the economy. Economic  activities have expanded in the last quarter \\ncompared to the first and second quarters of the current Fiscal Year. The arrival of tourists \\nhas nearly doubled compared to  the last Fiscal Year. The balance of payments is in surplus \\nwith increasing remittance inflow. The foreign currency reserve has been increasing. The \\ninterest rate of loans  is gradually decreasing due to the flexibility in monetary policy, \\nimprovement in banking system liquidity, and a decrease in the average base rate. I assure \\nyou that the government is firmly determined to put the economy back on  track through \\npolicy, systemic , and procedural reforms.  \\n25. I anticipate  positive spillover  effects on Nepal’s economy from the remarkable economic \\ndynamism  seen in the economies of neighbouring  countries , including India and China.  \\n26. Revenue  collection is expected to rise with an increase in imports and expansion of economic \\nactivities after the removal of import restrictions  on some items. I believe  that the policies \\nand programs proposed to improve the revenue system , along with  measures taken to \\ncontrol revenue leakage , will improve revenue mobilization in the coming days.  \\n27. I have proposed a reform in the budgetary system with an objective to contain regular \\nexpenditure within the desired limit and to strengthen allocative e fficiency and the capacity \\nof implementing agencies. I am hopeful that this will aid in making public expenditure \\neffective and result -oriented.  \\n28. I have emphasized increasing the base for high economic growth by expanding investment \\nfrom  government, private , and cooperative sectors, developing economic and social \\ninfrastructure , and increasing production, productivity , and employment opportunities while \\nconsidering  the challenges and opportunities mentione d above. I have set the objectives and \\npriorities of this budget with an understanding of  the need to minimize the gap between the \\n\\'haves\\'  and \\'have nots\\'  through appropriate and effective mobilization of  public resources \\nand equ itable distribution of resources.  \\nThe objectives of the budget for FY 2023/24 are as follows:  \\na) To attain broad, sustainable , and inclusive growth by invigorating  the \\neconomy . \\nb) To ensure qualitative social development, along with security and justice . \\nc) To boost the morale of the private sector by creating an investment -\\nfriendly environment , and to alleviate  poverty by generating  income and \\nemployment opportunities.  \\nd) To maintain macroeconomic stability . \\ne) To fortify  federalism and uphold  good governance . \\nf) To augment the  effectiveness of public expenditure through budgetary \\nreforms . \\nThe priorities of the budget are as follows:  NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSLATION  \\n6 a) Development of agri culture, energy , and tourism . \\nb) Promotion of investment , industrial development , and trade balance . \\nc) Advancement of the social sector and enhancement of social security . \\nd) Construction of high -quality physical infrastructure . \\ne) Promotion of digital and green economy . \\nf) Protection of the environment , climate change mitigation, and disaster \\nmanagement . \\ng) Development of human resources  and job creation . \\nh) Reform of the financial  sector . \\ni) Strengthening of fiscal federalism and enhancement of service delivery . \\nj) Reform in the public finance management system . \\nRight Honourable  Speaker,  \\nRight Honourable  Chairman,  \\nI have proposed the following  reforms to attain the objectives of the budget:  \\nBudget System  Reform and Capital Expenditure Effectiveness  \\n29. From  the upcoming year , arrangements will be made  to present the principles and priorities \\nof the Appropriation Bill in the federal parliament by mid -March , once  the ministry -wise \\nbudget ceiling is determined. I believe this will assist  in formulating a realistic b udget , \\nfounded  on the guidance and suggestions received from honourable  members following \\ncomprehensive  discussion on the principles and priorities of the Appropriation Bill.  \\n30. I have allocated the budget with priority gi ven to large and strategically significant  projects \\nand programmes  that provide  early returns and benefits to the majority of people , aiming  to \\ndiscourage resource  scattering . \\n31. I have adopted a policy to incorporate only those projects into the annual budget and \\nprogramme that have completed preparatory tasks,  including a detailed feasibility study and \\nland acquisition . Arrangements will be made to sign contract agreements only for projects \\nthat have completed processes  such as a detailed project report, an environmental impact \\nassessment, land acquisition , ensured site clearance and approved a procurement plan.  \\n32. The budget implementation action plan for the next fiscal year will be formulated by mid -July \\nand subsequently executed.  The action plan will be regularly monitored by the Office of the \\nPrime Minister and Counci l of Ministers, the Ministry of Finance , and the National Planning \\nCommission. The programme  implementing Ministry or agency will finalise  necessary \\nprocedures and directives by mid -August.  \\n33. Legal arrangements will be made to ascertain the number and species of trees to be cut, as \\nwell as the required forest area , during the Environmental Impact Assessment. Provisions will \\nbe made to mandate a  decision by the Ministry of Forest and Environment within 30 days \\nfollowing the duly submitted  Environmental Impact Assessment report for approval. Related NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSLATION  \\n7 laws will be amended to waive the need for supplementary environmental impact \\nassessments in cases  of up to 10 percent deviation in the number of trees to be cut.  \\n34. Necessary arrangements will be made to provide approval for the use of forest area and tree \\ncutting after approval of the Environmental Impact A ssessment Report. Similarly, \\narrangements will be made to issue tree-cutting orders  within fifteen days after receiving \\nsuch approval. I am confident that simplifying the process of forest l and ownership and tree \\ncutting approval  will boost project implementation . \\n35. The prevailing  legal provision to deposit an amount in the forest development fund will be \\nrepealed for the priority of the federal, provincial , and local levels. Legal provisions will be \\nmade to allow tree plantation in an area not less than one hectare, where land is unavailable \\nnear a national park or conservation area , in cases where  forest area is used fo r project \\nconstruction.  \\n36. The Land Acquisition Act will be amended to simplify and expedite  the land acquisition \\nprocess for the project . The standard for determining land compensation will be set and \\nimplemented based on the valuation of the Land Revenue Office, the local level , and the bank \\nfor mortgage.  \\n37. The rampant trend of providing resource assurance for multi -year contracts without actual \\nresources will be curtailed . New standards will be formulated to maintain budget discipline \\nby improving the existing system of seeking and approving resource assurance , addressing \\nresource management  problems . Arrangements will be made to provide  resource assur ance \\nin such a way that the requested assurance doesn\\'t  exceed four times the amount allocated \\nfor the project in that fiscal year.  \\n38. The duration of  resource assurance shall be a maximum of three years for national pride \\nprojects. If the cont ract agreement is not signed within nine months from the date of issuance \\nof resource assurance, the assurance will be automatically cancelled . I have cancelled  the \\nresource assurance of those projects which have  not begun  the bidding process and have \\npassed the  nine -month  period, and for which a  budget is not proposed for the next year.  \\n39. Necessary amendments will be made to the Act and Regulations to streamline  public \\nprocurement , making it s impler , transparent, and effective , by resolving the problems \\nidentified  in the procurement process. E -bidding will be further streamlined and extended to \\nall public entities.  \\n40. Contracts must  be awarded by mid-Novembe r for project  implementation . The allocated \\namount for the programme  can be withheld if the contract process does  not progress  within \\nthat time frame . Virement and programme  amendment will not be carried out up to the first \\nquarter of the fiscal year and during mid -June to mid -July. The trend of transferring budget \\nallocated to projects and programmes  in remote and backward areas  elsewhere will be \\nstrictly discoura ged.  NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSLATION  \\n8 41. Project and Departmental heads will be made responsible for achieving the targets set for \\ndevelopment projects and programmes . Criteria will be developed for the selection of the \\nproject head. A system will be developed to appoint the project head for the entire project \\nperiod or specified period and to transfer project heads based  only on performance , as \\nfrequent transfers  of project heads have  adversely affected implementation.  \\n42. The construction business will be made efficient, transparent, and systematic. An information \\nsystem will be developed so that the details of contract agreements and periodic progress \\nreports  throughout the country will be obtained in an integra ted manner. The Public \\nProcurement Monitoring Office will monitor the progress of contract agreements based on \\nthis system.  Legal provisions will be made to take  action , up to cancellation of the license , \\nbased  on the report submitted by the concerned project, if serious negligence is found during \\nthe monitoring process.  \\n43. Arrangements will be made to extract stones, gravel , and sand from quarries within the \\nstipulated time  if deemed  suitable based on environmental studies, in order to facilitate the \\nsupply of construction materials.  \\n44. Foreign aid will be mobilised  in productive sectors by increasing absorption capaci ty. I have \\nallocated internal loans  for use in development works. Public  debt will be mobilised  in high -\\nyielding sectors after carrying out a debt sustainability analysis.  \\n45. The selection and implementation of projects  will be based on mapping necessary \\ndevelopment infrastructure, including roads, schools , and health institutions, to ensure  \\nbenefit to the majority of the people.  \\n46. The project monitoring system  will be improved and made result -based. A monitoring \\ncommittee will be formed under the leadership of a member of the National Planning \\nCommission , consisting of officials from the Office of the Prime Minister and the Council of \\nMinisters, the Ministry  of Finance , and related ministries , to enhance the effectiveness of the \\nimplementation of programmes  and projects with allocations exceeding  one billion rupees. \\nThe implementation of the projects and programmes  will be monitored by incorporating \\nsuggestions and guidelines provided  by the monitoring committee into the integrated \\nmonitoring information system.  \\nAusterity i n Recurrent Expenses  \\n47. The recommendations offered by the Public Expenditure Review Commission, 2075  will be \\nimplemented  gradually. The institutions having overlapping jurisdiction with  the permanent \\nstructure of the government,  those which have lost their r elevance and 20 entities deemed \\nunnecessary in the changed context will be dissolved . Entities performing similar tasks will be \\nmerged. Various tourism  promotion and development committees depending on their \\njurisdiction and suitability for operation and m anagement from  the provincial and local levels, \\nwill be transferred to the respective levels. A detailed list of entities to be abolished, merged,  \\nrestructured, and transferred is included in the attached schedule. The relevant ministries NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSLATION  \\n9 will be required to manage the assets and liabilities of the abolished agencies by the end of \\nNovember.  \\n48. All allowances , including the incentive  allowance and extra hour allowance , will be abolished  \\nin the upcoming  fiscal year due to treasury  pressure . Purchases of new vehicles , furniture , \\nand furnishings will be discontinued . No new buildings  will be constructed in the next fiscal \\nyear , except for essentials . Austerity  will be observed regarding  fuel, office supplies , and \\nother administrative costs . Foreign visits will be discouraged , with the exception of \\nmandatory government representation . \\n49. Officials who receive vehicle facilities  will be provided with  cash for fuel , based on approved \\ncriteria . To curb escalating expenses incurred by government vehicles, a system will be \\ninitiated that offers  lump sum cash to officials entitled to  government vehicle facilities , as \\nopposed to providing the vehicles themselves . \\n50. In all government services, regulatory agencies , and public institutions, there will be no \\ncreation of new structures or posts in the coming f iscal  year. Existing  public administration \\nstructures and procedures will be reviewed and streamlined. Relevant  ministries and \\nagencies must complete organ isational  and management surveys  within November of the \\nnext fi scal year.  \\n51. A provision has been arranged stating that a separate entity  cannot be created for tasks \\nexecuted  by the regular government  structure , and consulting services cannot be engaged, \\nnor service contracts beyond  the approved posts be taken.  \\n52. Items such as old and unused vehicles in government agencies will be auc tioned off within six \\nmonths.  \\nEconomic Reforms  and Promotion  of the Private Sector  \\n53. An economic reform programme aimed at  structural transformation of the economy  will be \\ninitiated. This programme\\'s  focus will be on reducing the cost of doing business through \\ncompetitiveness  development , efficiency enhancement, institutional strengthening,  and \\nincreasing domestic and foreign investment . It will also focus on the development of green \\neconomy, information technology , innovation, fourth -generation industrialisation,  and \\ndigital economy  promotion. These reforms aim to make  the private sector the driving force  \\nof economic development.  \\n54. A business -friendly environment  will be created to boost private sector morale and attract  \\ndomestic and foreign capital and technology . I have proposed sectoral policy and procedural \\nreforms to enhance  production and productivity through  investment  expansion . \\n55. A digital  economy will be promoted for the country\\'s economic transformation . To this end, \\nthe development of communication infrastructure, establishment of digital banks , promotion \\nof the IT  industry , and the use of internet, mobile applications , and other networks in \\neconomic activities will be encouraged. This approach is expected to lower  the cost of NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSLATION  \\n10 financial transactions , save  time , enhance  efficiency , foster  transparency and good \\ngovernance , and improve competitiveness . \\n56. To reach  the goal of development and prosperity, a unified understanding  and policy \\nconsist ency among the three levels of government are crucial. Hence, I trust  that the \\nproposed policies will be adopted by the provincial and local levels to enhance  the project \\nand budget system and encourage  frugality in  spending.  \\n57. While immediate and complete resolution of the  challenges and problems observed  in the \\ncountry\\'s economy and budget system is not feasible,  sincer e efforts towards reforms have \\nbegun. Efforts to curb  the trend of scattering resources on smaller  projects without \\nprioritisation have been made, but not entirely successful  due to limited resources and \\nincreasing demands and expectations. In the next fiscal  year, the rationale and needs of \\nprogrammes  and projects will be intensely  reviewed , and the budget system will be further \\nreformed and restructured.  \\n58. I am confident  that the aforementioned policy and structural reforms will enhance  the \\neffectiveness of budget allocation and make the economy more vibrant . \\nRt. Hon.  Speaker,  \\nRt. Hon. Chairman,  \\n59. May I now  present the fiscal transfers according to Article 60 of the Constitution  of Nepal ? \\n60. I have arranged for revenue sharing and grant transfers to make funds available for  the \\nexecution  of jurisdictions at Federal, Provincial  and Local levels, in accordance with  the \\nconstitutional provision. Legal provisions  have been established for the  trans fer of \\nconditional, matching and special grants,  based on work -progress.  \\n61. A conditional grant has been assigned to execute  programs for alternative auxiliary highways \\nwith an allocation of up to 2.5 million rupees from the respective provinces , and programs \\nfor intensive urban development and settlement development from the respective local \\nlevels.  \\n62. A total of Rs. 146.02 billion has been arranged for fiscal transfer, including Rs. 5 8.67 billion to \\nProvinces and Rs . 87.35 billion to the local level under the fiscal equalisation  grant.  \\n63. Under the conditional grant, allocations have been  made of Rs. 35.72 billion to the province \\nand Rs. 191. 89 billion to localities, totalling  Rs. 227.61 billion.  \\n64. Under the complementary grant, the province will receive Rs. 6.22 billion and the local level \\nRs. 7. 05 billion , totalling  Rs. 13.27 billion.  Under a special grant, I have allocated R s. 4.46 \\nbillion and Rs. 8.73 billion  to provinces and local levels .  \\n65. I have estimated that a total of Rs. 173.92 billion will be transferred under revenue sharing.  \\nRight Honourable  Speaker , \\nRight Honourable  Chairman , NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSLATION  \\n11 I now seek permission to present the primary  sectoral programmes  and budget allocations for \\nthe upcoming  fiscal year.  \\nProduction,  Employment  and Innovation  \\n66. A national production and employment promotion program will be executed  at all local levels \\nwith the slogan \"Basis of a self-reliant economy: Production and Employment at Home\",  \\naimed at cultivating  a self -reliant economy by increasing production and employment \\nopportunities based on local economic potential. This program will primarily  focus on the \\ncommercialisation  of agriculture, promotion of micro and small industrie s, and the \\ndevelopment of the information technology and tourism sectors . Enterprises using barren \\nand unused land will be encouraged. The guidelines for this programme , which will be \\nexecuted  in coordination and cooperation with the local level, will be formulated by mid-\\nAugust. I have allocated  Rs. 7 billion for this program . \\n67. Domestic production and consumption will be encouraged through the Prime Minister\\'s \\nNepali Production and Consumption Enhancement Program . Micro, Cottage, Small, and \\nmedium scale industries based on indigenous raw materials will receive assis tance for  \\nprocessing , technology upgradation , storage and marketing. Industries with high internal \\nconsumption such as agriculture, ready -made garments, pharmaceuticals, and footwear will \\nbe encouraged. Arrangements will be made to use domestically produced goods in \\ngovernment agencies. I have allocated Rs. 500 million  for this program . \\n68. A policy will be adopted to spend  at least one percent of the government\\'s total capital \\nbudget on research, innovation and invention . I have allocated Rs. one billion  for \\nestablish ment of  a separate fund for research, innovation and inventio n. Necessary \\nlegislation will be formulated to operate the fund. Various government agency programs \\nfocused on research , invention , and innovation will be linked to it. Provinces and local levels \\nwill be encouraged to contribute to this fund. A separate unit will be established in the \\nMinistry of Education, Science and Technology to coordinate and facilitate work related to \\ninnovation, invention and research.  \\n69. A start -up ecosys tem will be developed to promote innovation and entrepreneurship in the \\ncountry. An incubation centre  will be operated in Kathmandu to cultivate  entrepreneurial \\nthinking and culture and transform this thinking into busin esses . Venture capital and private  \\nequity funds will be encouraged to invest in start -up businesses. Foreign investment flowing \\nthrough foreign investment companies will be encouraged and mobilised  for innovation and \\nentrepreneurship develo pment. To encourage start -ups, I have allocated Rs. 1.25 billion.  \\nPromotion of Internal  and Foreign Investment  \\n70. There will be a provision that , from now on,  no fees or charges will be levied on company \\nregistration  and capital increment.  A legal provision will be made to open a company with \\neven a disclosing minimum authorised  capital of Rs. One hundred. The process will be made \\nsimple and transparent , enabling  companies to register  and cancel  online. The process of NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSLATION  \\n12 obtaining visas for investors and skilled manpower in foreign -invested industries will be made \\nsimple and flexible.  \\n71. Services such as industry  registration, investment approval and others  will be made  available \\nonline  from a single window . Legal arrangements related to leases and handovers will be \\nreviewed to facilitate  the easy availability of land required for the establishment of \\nproducti on and export -oriented  industries . \\n72. A national portal will be prepared to ensure  all necessary information is available for \\ninvestors. This portal will include all information including investment areas, opportunities, \\nlegal and policy arrangements, incentive arrangements, investment return provisions and \\nprocedures.  \\n73. Necessary laws  will be amended to adopt a flexible labour  policy for information technology \\nand innovation -based industries. Grants will be provided through the Technology \\nDevelopment Fund to encourage the use of clean energy and green technology in the \\nindustry.  \\n74. Legal and policy stability will be maintained  for foreign investment. The foreign  direct \\ninvestment approval process will be simplified and automated. The minimum threshold  of \\nforeign investment will be re viewed  and set on sector -to-sector basis . \\n75. Threshold on foreign  investment in information technology industry will be removed. The \\nforeign  exchange facility to the extent of 10 percent of foreign currency income will be \\ngranted to the industries operating for  the purpose of exporting information te chnology \\nservices to establish contact  offices in third countries and to purchase software or programs \\nand install  equipment.  \\n76. Arrangements will be made  so as to get approval through an automatic route when making \\ninvestments in industries that are open to foreign investment  except for  the industries that \\nrequire permission according to existing law . Reinvestment of income earned from foreign \\ninvestment will not require approval. The time limit for bringing in foreign investment will be \\nreviewed and made  practical.  \\n77. To mobilise  private capital in infrastructure projects, legal arrangements will be made \\nregarding the establishment of an infrastructure fund with the participation of domestic and \\nforeign investors. The private sector will be attracted by providing viability gap funding for \\nprojects of national importance. A legal arrangement will be made so that large infrastructure \\nprojects of national importance can be constructed under public -private partnerships  using \\nthe hyb rid annuity model.  \\n78. The capacity of the Investment Board will be enhanced  to promote foreign investment. An \\ninvestment conference will be organised  in 2023/24 to attract foreign investment in areas of \\ncomparative advantage. Proposals  for foreign investment will be invited after completion of \\npreparatory work and identification of possible large  projects such as expressways, tunnels, \\nand reservoir hydropower . NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSLATION  \\n13 79. The necessary legal infrastructure will be prepared to mobilise  long -term capital from the \\ninternational financial market. Invest ible capital will be raised through innovative  financial \\ninstruments , such as local currency -based green bonds  and energy bonds,  to invest in large \\nand reservoir -based hydropower projects, transmission lines and other infrastructure.  \\n80. Facilitation  will be provided  for the private sector to obtain  loans includi ng from foreign \\nfinancial institutions. Foreign capital will be mobilised  in areas of increasing production and \\nproductivity using alternative and innovative  tools including blended finance.  \\n81. To improve the investment environment, the country credit rating process will be carried \\nforward. Hedging services will be provided to foreign investors to minimise  foreign exchange \\nrisk by designating hedging agency.  \\n82. The security  of foreig n investment will be guaranteed. The procedure for repatriation of \\ndividends by foreign investors will be simplified. The process of bilateral investment \\npromotion and protection agreements  and double taxation avoidance  agreements  will be  \\ninitiated after identifying the countries where foreign investment can flow. The trust of \\nforeign investors will be gained by incorporating the established principles of the \\ninternational tax system into the national tax law.  \\n83. \\'Make  in Nepal\\'  and \\'Made  in Nepal\\'  campaigns, promoted by the private sector , will be \\nencouraged to promote and expand indigenous production. Capital, technology, experience \\nand skills of non -resident Nepalis will be prioritised  for national development.  \\nTransformation  of the Agricultural Sector  \\n84. Emphasis will be placed on increasing the production and productivity of the agricultural \\nsector, which serves as  the main foundation  of the national economy. Appropriate \\narrangements  will be  made for  modernisation  and commercialisation  of the agricultural \\nsector , along with  for storage and marketing of agricultural produce. The program will  accord \\nhigh  priorit y to food and nutrition security.  \\n85. Agricultural subsidies will be linked to  production  under the slogan  \\'Production  in Place, \\nSubsidy in Hand\\' . All agricultural s ubsidies  will be tied to  production  except those provided \\nfor purchase  of seeds, chemical fertilisers , insurance , and for mechanisation . To ensure a \\nsystematic and transparent  grant system,  new standards and procedures will be formulated \\nand implemented by  mid-August.  I anticipate  that this will address the common complaint \\nthat agricultural subsidies are not being utilised  and will help increase production by \\nbenefit ting real farmers.  I believe that even provincial and local levels will adopt an \\nagricultural subsidy system tied to  production.  \\n86. The Prime Minister\\'s  Agriculture Modernisation  project  will implement  16 super zones  and \\n177 zones for technology expansion, mech anisation , intern deployment , and learning and \\nearning programmes . The program will be executed  in 660 blocks operating at  the provincial \\nlevel  and 1 ,053  pocket areas operating  at the local level. I have allocated Rs. 3.22 billion  for \\nthe Prime Minister\\'s Agriculture Modernisation  Project . NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSLATION  \\n14 87. Gradual efforts  will be made  to ensure the country\\'s  self-sufficiency  in quality seed supply . \\nThe pri vate sector will be encouraged to engage in national research and development of \\nquality seeds. If farmers purchase  high -quality and high -yielding seeds from producers , 50% \\nof the cost will be subsidise d through the relevant local level. For this, I have allocated Rs. 400 \\nmillion.  \\n88. Under  the slogan \"Let\\'s be proud of Indigenous \", the cultivation of traditional, natural , and \\nnutritious indigenous food crops will be protected and expanded. Marsi Paddy of Jumla, \\nGinger of Palpa and Salyan, Coffee of Gulmi, and Potatoes of Mustang will be branded  and \\nmarketed . Indigenous crop production , including marsi, kaguno, mille t, phapar , barley, latte, \\nand beans in various  places in the  Karnali province , will be purchased through the Food  and \\nTrade Company . \\n89. I have allocated Rs . 30 billion  to provide subsidies  to farmers for chemical fertilisers . The \\nprocurement process for chemical fertilisers will be improved to ensure timely supply. The  \\nsupply and distribution process of fertilisers will be m ade systematic and transparent. A \\ndetailed project report will be prepared to  establish a chemical fertiliser  factory within  the \\ncountry , and the work will be carried out through a Public -Private Partnership facilitated by \\nthe Investment Board.  \\n90. With the slogan, \"Technical services on spot, support to production \", I have allocated Rs. \\n470 million to ensure the availability of agricultural  and livestock husbandry technicians  at \\nevery local level. I believe that this will enable farmers to access  technical services in their  \\nfields.  \\n91. To achieve self -sufficiency in rice and potato production, the cultivation of rice and potatoes  \\nwill be extended to one hundred local levels. Production -based grants  will be provided to \\npromote the development of hybrid rice and the expansion o f spring paddy cultivation.  \\n92. A program  will be implemented to promote organic agriculture production and usage. \\nArrangements  will be made to provide production -based grants  to farmers engaged in \\norganic and conven tional farming. The market for  organic agricultural products will be \\npromoted through certification , branding , and the encouragement of  exports . Support will \\nbe provided to encourage the production of compost and vermicompost  at the community \\nlevel.  \\n93. A program  will be implemented to promote organic farming without the use of  pesticides and \\nchemical fertilisers . Government agricultural farms will initiate organic farming as a model. I \\nbelieve  that this initiative will help  preserve soil fertility, restore depleted soil nutrients, and \\nensure the availability of healthy agricultural products at lower production costs.  \\n94. Conditional grants will be provided for establishin g and upgrading  state -level laboratories for \\nsoil testing , manpower management, and capacity development . The use of organic fertilisers  \\nand agri -lime will be encouraged to control soil acidity in arable land.  NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSLATION  \\n15 95. Successful farmers in agriculture, horticulture, vegetables, and animal husbandry will be  \\nencouraged to share and transfer their experience and knowledge to inspire individuals \\ninterested in agricultural entrepreneurship.  Agricultural knowledge centres  will identify these  \\nfarmers, classify them as mentor farmers , and mobilise  them as agricultural extension agents. \\nIn coordination with provincial governments , the Presidential Outstand ing Farmers Award \\nwill be given  to honour  and motivate the agriculture profession.  \\n96. Priority will be given to promoting sugarcane  production and species development. To \\nenhance sugarcane  production, Rs. 80 0 million  have been allocated  to subsidise  production \\ncosts  for farmers.  \\n97. The forage development and nutrient improvement program will be impl emented in one \\nhundred local levels for cultivating  various forage species , including Jai, Nepiyar, Mendula, \\nand Versim , under  the campaign of \"Let\\'s  develop nutritious forage and increase livestock \\nproduction .\" Forage seed  production programs will be implemented through local levels. \\nRegulatory arrangements  for animal feed quality measurement and price regulation will be \\nmade effective.  \\n98. To attract youth and develop their entrepreneurial skills  in agriculture and livestock business, \\nthe \" Youth Start -up Program \" will be implemented in collaboration with local levels. An  \\namount of Rs . 1.20 billion has been allocated for this purpose.  The program for the \\ndevelopment of small -scale farmer enterprises will be gradually expanded to all local levels \\nby promoting financial access and fostering  entrepreneurship among  youth in the ag ricultural \\nsector.  \\n99. Land pooling will be encouraged for agricultural  farming , and legal  frameworks will be \\ndeveloped for contract farming. Barren lands will be utilised  for contract and collective \\nfarming by developing standards  in coordination with local levels . I have allocated Rs. 300 \\nmillion for this.   \\n100. I have allocated Rs. 950 million in the next fiscal year for subsidies on premiums  for crop and \\nlivestock insurance for over  200,000 farmers.  \\n101. Measures , including fences, will be adopted in collaboration with provincial and local levels \\nto prevent and minimise  damage caused by wild ani mals such as  elephants, monkeys, boars , \\nand Nilgai . \\n102. Budget has been  allocated for the construction of structures, including agricultural markets, \\ncold storage facilities, and food storage houses in collaboration with local levels. Budget has \\nbeen  allocated for the completion of fruit and vegetable  markets in Chobhar. The \\nconstruction  of infrastructure for agri-products  export markets  will be initiated. Budget has \\nbeen  allocated for the completion of construction projects for  agriculture wholesale \\nmarket s, including Rangeli in Morang, Banganga in Kapilvastu, Kageshori Manohara and \\nBudhanilkantha in Kathmandu, and Bardibas in Mohattari.  NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSLATION  \\n16 103. Minimum Support Prices  for major crops , including rice and wheat , will be determined \\nbefore harvesting to ensure that farmers receive  fair prices for their products. The supply  \\nchain for agricultural  produce, from production to the market, will be reformed to ensure  \\nthat farmers receiv e fair prices.  \\n104. Agricultural cooperatives will be promoted to expand  the collection, storage, and market \\naccess of agricultural  produce. Tax exemptions  on the purchase of agricultural produce \\ntransport and  support for the construction of collection centres  will be provided to such \\ncooperatives.  \\n105. Feasibility studies  will be conducted for the cultivation of cannabis for medicinal purposes.  \\n106. The laboratory  service of Rapid Pesticide Residue tests  will be expanded to five additional \\nlocations : Dharan, Sindhuli, Dhanusha, Kavrepalanchok, and Surkhet. The range of tests  for \\npossible pesticide residues in food items will be expanded. Gradual upgrades to an \\ninternational level will be implemented for  food technology, animal feed, and livestock \\ndisease research laboratories . \\n107. Vaccination campaigns  will be conducted to control lives tock epidemics. Necessary budget \\nhas been  allocated for the domestic production of approximately  56 million doses of \\nvaccines for various diseases. Around 500,000 doses of semen from improved breeds of \\ncows, buffaloes, and goats will be produced , and artificial insemination services will be \\nexpanded to all local levels in the upcoming fiscal year to increase production and \\nproductivity through the improvement of livestock breeds.  \\n108. The Nepal Agricult ural Research Council will develop new  varieties and technologies in rice, \\napples , millet, maize, barley, sunflower , and ginger . \\n109. The roles and responsibilities of the federal, provincial , and local levels in agricultural \\ndevelopment will be clearly defined when  formulating the Federal Agriculture Act. I believe \\nthis will further manage the conservation of arable land, commercialisation  of agriculture, \\nmarket management, and regulation activities , while enhancing coordination between \\ndifferent levels of government.  \\n110. I have allocated a budget of Rs. 58.98 billion for the Ministry of Ag riculture and Livestock \\nDevelopment.  \\nForestry and Environment  \\n111. Environmental balance will be maintained through the management of forests , \\nbiodiversity, and water resource s. The  sustainable utilization of forest resources and the \\ndevelopment of  forest -based enterprises  will contribute to the national economy.  \\nProtected areas and community forests will be developed as eco -tourism destinations.  \\n112. The Chure Conse rvation Master Plan will be implemented with the participation of the \\nfederal, provincial , and local levels under the President Chure Conservation Program. \\nActivities such as  bamboo plantation, recharge ponds, trenches , and landslide control will NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSLATION  \\n17 be carried out to conserve water and soil. A budget of Rs. 1.05 billion has been allocated \\nfor the President Chure Conservation Program.  \\n113. Budget has been  allocated for the protection of trenches and lakes, the conservation of \\nwetlands , and  the operation of water recharge programs in large watershed areas such as  \\nKoshi, Gandaki, Karnali , and Mahakali for the sustainable management of soil and water \\nresources.  \\n114. Programs will be launched to develop agroforestry by cultivating medicinal plants, fruits \\nand vegetables, forage crops , and others in barren, fallow, Ailani , Parti , and degraded forest \\nareas, linking forests  with people\\'s lives  and prosperity. Thirty million saplings will be \\nplanted in collaboration with the provinces  in the coming year . \\n115. Budget has been  allocated for quality sapling production and the development of pocket \\nareas in prospective areas of the Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces  to promote the \\ncommercial cultivation of medicinal plants. Export will be promoted through the  processing \\nof medicinal plants and the certifica tion of their essence extracts.  \\n116. Infrastructure , including electric fences , will be constructed in national parks, forests, and \\nbuffer zones to develop bio -routes, manage grassland and wetland areas , manage wildlife \\nhabitats,  and minimiz e damage caused by wildlife. Livelihood improvement programs  will \\nbe implemented to improve the livelihoods of residents in buffer zones.  The construction \\nwork of Parsa Natural Zoo will be advanced after completing  all preparatory work.  \\n117. The distribution process of relief for damage caused by wildlife will be made convenient \\nand simple. All employees working in parks  and protected areas will be insured against \\naccidents. Programs will be implemented for the conservation of endanger ed and rare \\nwildlife.  \\n118. Budget has  been allocated for the procurement of materials and the operation of training \\nprograms to control the risk of wildfires  in collaboration with the provinces.  \\n119. Sustainable  forest management programs will be implemented in coordination and \\ncollaboration with the federal, provincial, and local levels. Thirty million cubic feet of timber \\nwill be supplied through national, community, and private forest  managemen t with the \\npreparation of certain standards in the upcoming fiscal year. This will help to substitute the \\nimport of timber and furniture.  \\n120. Private sectors will be encouraged to produce bio -pellets and briquettes using leaf litter  \\nand invasive species  found  in forest areas. I believe, this will not only contribute to \\nincreased  renewable energy production but also reduce coal consumption.  \\n121. Air quality monitoring centres  will be expanded in Ilam, Mustang, Dang, and Achham. The \\nuse of biodegradable  or cotton bags instead of plastic bags will be encouraged. Promotional \\nactivities for environmental conservation will be implemented.  \\n122. I have all ocated a budget of Rs. 15.56 billion for the Ministry of Forests and Environment.  NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSLATION  \\n18 Land Management and Cooperatives  \\n123. Land administration -related work  will be made information and communication \\ntechnology -based with the slogan of \"Good Governance in Land Administration .\" An online \\nland information technology system will be implemented in the upcoming fiscal year in all \\nSurvey Offices  and Land Management and Revenue Offices. Necessary arrangements  will \\nbe made to e nable service recipients to access  services such as trace maps , hypothecation , \\nand withholding electronically.  \\n124. Survey offices and land revenue offices will be gradually integrated to deliver services  \\nthrough a one-window syste m, making land administration more efficient and organized. \\nThe use of modern LiDAR technology for survey mapping will continue . Land \\nadministration -related laws will be amended to enable the local level to deliver basic land \\nmanagement and survey -related services . \\n125. The identification, dataset collection, verification, and mapping of landless Dalits, squatters, \\nand unorganized settlers will be completed. Land  ownership certificates will be  distributed \\nto 25,000 landless individuals in 110 local levels  through the Land Commission in the \\nupcoming fiscal year.  \\n126. Land  ownership certificates  will be provided after surveying the village block land that has \\nnot yet been  surveyed  and registering the self -residing land that has not yet been  registered \\nin the absence of legal evidence. Surveys  of rural block areas will be completed in the \\nupcoming fiscal year.  \\n127. Arrangements  will be made to classify  land for agriculture and other purposes on  a scientific \\nbasis.

The \\nprimary  objective of the revenue policy will be to  make revenue mobilisation  sustainable, \\nreliable, systematic , and predictable  aiming  to generate the necessary resources for the \\ncountry\\'s infrastructure development and to ensure citizen  welfare and socio -economic \\njustice ; improve the stan dard of living by enhancing  investment in and expanding citizen  \\naccess  to fundamental services  and facilities , including education  and health . To achieve \\nthe above objectives, the following revenue policy will be adopted.  \\na) To gradually transform the import -based revenue structure towards direct tax and \\ndomestic production -based.  \\nb) To enhance entrepreneurship, attract internal and foreign investment , and protect \\nand promote domestic industries through the revenue policy . \\nc) To improve the industrial and business environment of the country by ensuring the \\nconceptual stability of the tax policy . \\nd) To broaden the tax base b y bringing all taxable transactions under the tax net , \\nsafeguarding  taxing rights , and discouraging all types of informal and illegal economic \\nactivities and abuse of policy loopholes.  \\ne) To enhance voluntary tax participation and compliance by  making the revenue \\nsystem technology -friendly, automatic, transparent, and taxpayer -friendly , and  \\nf) To make the campaign against all types of fraud, evasion , and leakage control \\neffective by making necessary legal reforms and maintaining eff ective coordination \\nbetween agencies responsible for revenue leakage control.  \\nReform in Tax System  \\n449. A high -level committee will be formed  for the reform of the existing tax system.  NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSLATION  \\n53 450. Interoperability between institutional information systems will be maintained and made \\nautomatic to integrate and utilise  information pertaining to  economic transactions.  \\n451.

Arrangements  have been made  for taxpayers who are registered under Value Added Tax \\nand whose annual business totals  up to Rs. 10 million , to now  submit tax and tax details \\nevery four months instead of the current provision of monthly submission .

This \\nwill make processes  such as imposing customs duties, determining tariffs, setting or \\nchanging customs duties , more  transparent, predictable , and compatible with international \\ngood practices . \\n460. Arrangements will be made to allow taxpayers to issue invoices for the sale of goods and \\nservi ces through the Central Billing Monitoring System , by improving the aforementioned \\nsystem of the Internal Revenue Department.

Transfer pricing will be controlled through measures to prevent tax erosion, profit shifting, \\nand income splitting.  \\nDiscounts and Concessions  \\n481. In order to protect the interests of consumers by controlling and discouraging the use of \\nlow quality, fake and illegally imported goods, I have arranged for the packaging of goods \\nimported after 17 July 2023  to be sent to the market only with the label of  the importer and \\nmarket distributor.  \\n482. I have cancelled  the 170-discount  rate of value added tax and 340 discount rate of excise \\nduty to expand the tax base by reviewing the discount and concession system . NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSLATION  \\n56 483.

From the comin g fiscal  year, I have given a customs duty exemption to a \\ntelevision set of any size brought by a person who has joined the social security fund and \\nreturned from working abroad for at least twelve consecutive months.  \\n484. In order to protect the domestic produ ction of industrial goods that are self -reliant  in the \\ncountry, I have increased the duty on the import of some goods. Also , in order to promote \\nthe production of the indigenous industry , the agreement will not be made to exempt the \\nimport duties of the goods that are sufficiently available in the country, such as cement , \\niron rods , iron pipes and plastic pipes , zinc sheets , electrical cables, etc. , which are required \\nfor the projects to  be signed after the 1 7th of July 2023. I have made an arrangement that \\nthe indigenous industry can sell such goods to the project by giving a discount on value -\\nadded  tax and excise duty.  \\n485.
